 **# Calculator App**

**This project is a simple calculator app built using React.**

**Key features:**

- **Basic arithmetic operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear and user-friendly interface:** Features a large display for input and results, distinct buttons for operations, and clear labels for actions.
- **Input history:** Displays previous calculations for reference.
- **Error handling:** Gracefully handles invalid input and potential errors.

**Installation and setup:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Gargshruti19/Calculator-React`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Calculator-React`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm start`

**Usage:**

1. Access the app in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000/`.
2. Enter numbers and operators using the buttons provided.
3. Click the "=" button to evaluate the expression.
4. Use the "C" button to clear the last input or "AC" to clear all input and results.

**Additional notes:**

- The app utilizes React's state management to maintain input and result values.
- The `eval` function is used for calculation, but consider alternative approaches for security and robustness in production environments.
- Explore opportunities for further enhancements, such as:
    - Additional mathematical functions (e.g., square root, percentages)
    - Memory storage for calculations
    - Customizable themes and color schemes
    - Accessibility features
- Open for contribution
